                    <p>
                        I'm Jayson Sandhu, a passionate software engineer with a deep love for building impactful
                        technology.
                        With over 5 years of experience in software development and technical support, I've honed my
                        skills
                        across various programming languages, from Java and Python to Swift and Go.
                        <br><br>
                        Having worked with top companies like Apple and IBM, I've learned to bridge the gap between
                        cutting-edge
                        innovation and user-centric solutions. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's
                        developing AI
                        for drones or designing cloud-native applications that scale seamlessly.
                        <br><br>
                        But beyond the code, I'm driven by the potential technology holds to create meaningful
                        change—whether
                        that's through better user experiences, more efficient systems, or new approaches to modern
                        challenges.
                        When I'm not working on code, you can find me exploring new tech trends or diving into the
                        latest
                        developments in AI.
