            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science graduate with over 5 years of experience in programming and technical support.
                Currently excelling as a Technical Expert at Apple, I am skilled in solving complex technical issues and
                proficient in multiple programming languages. I have participated in co-op programs with IBM in Drone
                Development and Cloud Engineering, gaining hands-on experience in software development. My passion for
                using technology to solve problems and improve user experiences drives my work, and I am eager to bring
                my technical expertise and leadership skills to a software engineering role.
