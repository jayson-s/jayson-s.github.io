                    <p>
                        Hello! I’m Jayson Sandhu, a results-driven software engineer with a passion for impactful 
                        technology.
                        With over 5 years of experience in software development and technical support, I 
                        specialize in delivering innovative, user-focused solutions. My expertise spans programming 
                        languages including Java, Python, C++.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout my career, I have tackled complex challenges, 
                        from developing AI-powered drone systems to designing scalable cloud-native applications, 
                        bridging cutting-edge innovation with real-world impact while working with industry leaders 
                        like Apple and IBM.
                        <br><br>
                        But beyond the code,  I am deeply committed to giving back to my community. As a mentor 
                        for junior athletes in cricket, I draw on my 18 years of experience as a player and coach to 
                        promote teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles—values that shape my approach to both 
                        work and life.
                        <br><br>    
                        I am inspired by the transformative potential of technology to solve real-world problems and 
                        create meaningful change. Outside of work, I stay engaged with emerging trends in AI and 
                        technology, constantly seeking opportunities to grow, innovate, and contribute to the field 
                        and my community.
